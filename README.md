This project is in **early alpha development** and is **not usable for production**. The alpha version is designed so that miners can test and report all bugs through our [Bug Bounty Program](https://github.com/PlatformNetwork/bounty-challenge). Commits will be **very frequent** during the alpha phase. Expect rapid updates and breaking changes as we iterate quickly toward a stable release.

**No pre-built binaries will be published during the alpha.** Developers must build the project themselves from source.

## Vision

Cortex IDE aims to be the most complete IDE for AI, specialized in **agent orchestration**. Unlike traditional IDEs with AI bolted on, Cortex IDE is built AI-first — every feature is designed around intelligent agent workflows.
